A plugin is an external module which can be “plugged in” to your server to add custom features, change default behaviours and more.

## Before You Start

## Plugin Structure

In your Pocketmine Server folder you would find a folder called `plugins` in there create a new folder and that folder will be your plugin, rename that folder to your plugin name, we will be renaming it to TestPlugin.   

In the plugin folder or TestPlugin create a file named `plugin.yml` and a folder named `src`.

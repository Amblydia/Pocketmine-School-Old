# Intro

## What's FormAPI?

FormAPI is a simple API for creating forms for Minecraft PE/BE clients.  

It was created by jojoe77777  
His Github: <https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI>  
His Discord: <https://discord.gg/MzKQpWZ>  

## Installation

Well you can either download FormAPI from github and put it in your source code or use the DEvirion plugin.

If you are using poggit you can edit poggit.yml where you can specify which virions you use:

```yml
libs:
  - src: jojoe77777/FormAPI/libFormAPI
    version: ^1.3
```

and then the .phars will have the virions injected in them.

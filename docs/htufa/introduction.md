## What's FormAPI?
FormAPI is a simple API for creating forms for Minecraft PE/BE clients.  

It was created by jojoe77777  
His Github: https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI   
His Discord: https://discord.gg/MzKQpWZ  

## How to install?  
Well you can either download formapi from github and put it in your source code or use the DEvirion plugin.  
Or  
You can edit poggit.yml where you can specify which virions you use:
```
libs:
    - src: jojoe77777/FormAPI/libFormAPI
      version: ^1.3
```
and then the .phars will have the virions injected in them.  
You can also add this in your plugin.yml to avoid crashes: 
```
depend: FormAPI
```
